-- The dataset contains quantitative data about TB cases, territories, and other relevant data. Data cleansing was complicated as the dataset was large, and the process needed some automation. The process mostly consisted of cleaning irrelevant data and/or incorrect data such as Null values. After that, data statistics were put out if any of the data had important information. Once that was done, data visualization was placed. Data visualization came in as graphs. A summary from the data is derived from two columns, i.e, 'Region', and 'Estimated prevalence of TB (all forms)'. The data provides that the highest prevalence of TB is Africa, with Europe coming in second.

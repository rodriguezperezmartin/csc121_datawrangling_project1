# CSC121_DataWrangling_Project_1

## Project Description
This project will provide you with the opportunity to apply the concepts and techniques learned in the Data Wrangling module to a real-world dataset - the Tuberculosis Burden by Country. Estimates the prevalence and mortality of Tuberculosis by country. Source of this dataset is the World Health Organization. You will be required to collect, clean, and analyze a dataset of your choice. You will also be required to present your findings in a report.

The project will be completed in two parts. In the first part, you will collect and clean the data in TB_Burden_Country.csv. In the second part, you will analyze the data and present your findings in a report.

## Project Objectives
The objectives of this project are as follows:
- To collect and clean the dataset provided in the loa_data directory.
- To analyze the dataset and present your findings in a report.

## Project Requirements
To complete this project, you will need to perform the following tasks:
- Collect and clean the dataset provided in the loa_data directory.
- This will include loading the dataset into a pandas DataFrame, cleaning the data, and saving the cleaned data to a new file. As part of data cleansing the following processes will be performed:
  - Remove any duplicate rows.
  - Remove any rows with missing values.
  - Remove any rows with invalid values.
  - Remove any rows with outliers.
  - Remove any rows with inconsistent values.
- Undergo preliminary data analysis to understand the dataset. This will include things like:
  - Descriptive statistics.
  - Data visualization.
  - Data transformation.
  - Data aggregation.
- Present your findings in a report. This will include things like:
  - A description of the dataset.
  - A summary of the data cleansing process.
  - A summary of the data analysis process.
  - A summary of the findings.

Delivery:
- Submit your project as a Jupyter Notebook and push your project back up to this github repository in your own branch.
- Due date is: Monday, October 7th at 10pm.
